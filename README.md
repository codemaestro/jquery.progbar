CoV - Progress bar for visual status

This simple HTML/CSS progress bar is used by CoV applications. As the code is readily available for anyone who cares to look, I didn't see a problem with posting it publicly.

CoV Progress Bar demonstrates:
- A CSS solution for a progress bar tht responds to mobile device screen sizes (< 620px).
- A simple jQuery plugin to set the width of the bar to that of its container.

Known issues: While the jQuery version appears to work with all browsers, Mac OS X Firefox and Safari reveal rendering issues. May be due to the jQuery 1.7.2 library. Will try to fix later.

Enjoy!
